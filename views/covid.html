                        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                            <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>    
                            <li> Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>  
                            <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li> 
                            <li> Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>   
                            <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <p>
                        Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3><b>Masks</b></h3>
                        Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.

                        <li>Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        <h3><b>Medical Treatments</b></h3>
                        Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.</li>
                            <li>Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.
